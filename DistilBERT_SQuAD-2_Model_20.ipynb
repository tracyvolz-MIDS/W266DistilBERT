Main differences include:\n","\n"," - The DistilBERT model was pre-trined using SQuAD 2.0, rather than SQuAD 1.0\n"," - Exploring traditional split that included unseen test data  (i.e. not validation data)\n"," - Addition of adhoc dropout rate setting\n"," - Addition of alternate dataloader with Fixed-Length Truncation\n"," - Addition of performance analysis for each category\n","\n","...."],"metadata":{"id":"a5LmXSzh-iRq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import

Question: what would an example of lossy audio encoding be? when performing lossy audio encoding, such as creating an mp3 file, there is a trade - off between the amount of space used and the sound quality of the result. typically, the creator is allowed to set a bit rate, which specifies how many kilobits the file may use per second of audio. the higher the bit rate, the larger the compressed file will be, and, generally, the closer it will sound to the original file.\n","   Predicted: creating an mp3 file\n","   Truth: creating an mp3 file\n","\n","2. Question: in what year was plymouth recognized as a town? the first record of the existence of a settlement at plymouth was in the domesday book in 1086 as sudtone, saxon for south farm, located at the present day barbican. from saxon times, it was in the hundred of roborough. in 1254 it gained status as a town and in 1439, became the first town in england to be granted a charter by parliament. between 1439 and 1934, plymouth had a mayor. in 1914 the county boroughs of plymouth and devonport, and the urban district of east stonehouse merged to form a single county borough of plymouth. collectively they were referred to as \" the three towns \".\n","   Predicted: 1254\n","   Truth: 1254\n","\n","3. Question: what field of study speculates about science fiction? there is considerable speculation both in science and science fiction as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter, and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter instead. in the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called the charge parity ( or cp symmetry ) violation. cp symmetry violation can be obtained from the standard model, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis.\n","   Predicted: \n","   Truth: \n","\n","4. Question: what do phosphor - based leds luminous efficacies depend on? phosphor - based led efficiency losses are due to the heat loss from the stokes shift and also other phosphor - related degradation issues. their luminous efficacies compared to normal leds depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the led itself. for example, the luminous efficacy of a typical yag yellow phosphor based white led ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue led because of the human eye ' s greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue ( as modeled in the luminosity function ). due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high - intensity white leds. the design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex rgb system, and the majority of high - intensity white leds presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.\n","   Predicted: the spectral distribution of the resultant light output\n","   Truth: the spectral distribution of the resultant light output\n","\n","5.

Question: in which century did physicists encounter problems with the understanding of time? in non - relativistic classical mechanics, newton ' s concept of \" relative, apparent, and common time \" can be used in the formulation of a prescription for the synchronization of clocks. events seen by two different observers in motion relative to each other produce a mathematical concept of time that works sufficiently well for describing the everyday phenomena of most people ' s experience. in the late nineteenth century, physicists encountered problems with the classical understanding of time, in connection with the behavior of electricity and magnetism. einstein resolved these problems by invoking a method of synchronizing clocks using the constant, finite speed of light as the maximum signal velocity. this led directly to the result that observers in motion relative to one another measure different elapsed times for the same event.\n","   Predicted: nineteenth\n","   Truth: the late nineteenth century\n","   F1 Score: 0.500\n","\n","4. Question: are fungi more like plants or animals? from the 1990s onwards, the predominant approach to constructing phylogenies for living plants has been molecular phylogenetics, which uses molecular characters, particularly dna sequences, rather than morphological characters like the presence or absence of spines and areoles. the difference is that the genetic code itself is used to decide evolutionary relationships, instead of being used indirectly via the characters it gives rise to. clive stace describes this as having \" direct access to the genetic basis of evolution. \" as a simple example, prior to the use of genetic evidence, fungi were thought either to be plants or to be more closely related to plants than animals. genetic evidence suggests that the true evolutionary relationship of multicelled organisms is as shown in the cladogram below – fungi are more closely related to animals than to plants.\n","   Predicted: animals\n","   Truth: closely related to animals\n","   F1 Score: 0.400\n","\n","5. Question: which party was anti - slavery? the united states has become essentially a two - party system. since a conservative ( such as the republican party ) and liberal ( such as the democratic party ) party has usually been the status quo within american politics. the first parties were called federalist and republican, followed by a brief period of republican dominance before a split occurred between national republicans and democratic republicans. the former became the whig party and the latter became the democratic party. the whigs survived only for two decades before they split over the spread of slavery, those opposed becoming members of the new republican party, as did anti - slavery members of the democratic party. third parties ( such as the libertarian party ) often receive little support and are very rarely the victors in elections. despite this, there have been several examples of third parties siphoning votes from major parties that were expected to win ( such as theodore roosevelt in the election of 1912 and george wallace in the election of 1968 ). as third party movements have learned, the electoral college ' s requirement of a nationally distributed majority makes it difficult for third parties to succeed. thus, such parties rarely win many electoral votes, although their popular support within a state may tip it toward one party or the other. wallace had weak support outside the south. more generally, parties with a broad base of support across regions or among economic and other interest groups, have a great chance of winning the necessary plurality in the u. s. ' s largely single - member district, winner - take - all elections. the tremendous land area and large population of the country are formidable challenges to political parties with a narrow appeal.\n","   Predicted: democratic party. third parties ( such as the libertarian party\n","   Truth: democratic party\n","   F1 Score: 0.400\n","\n","❌ Failed Examples (EM=0, F1 < 0.3 or F1 > 0.7):\n","\n","1.

Question: which group of people did the wagner act fail to protect? the first appearance of the term ' affirmative action ' was in the national labor relations act, better known as the wagner act, of 1935. : 15 proposed and championed by u. s. senator robert f. wagner of new york, the wagner act was in line with president roosevelt ' s goal of providing economic security to workers and other low - income groups. during this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. the wagner act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a national labor relations board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. in the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through ' affirmative action '. while the wagner act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the congress of industrial organizations, were often barred from union ranks. : 11 this original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual ' s unjust treatment.
