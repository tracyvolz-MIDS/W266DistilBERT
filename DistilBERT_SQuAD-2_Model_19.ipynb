Finetuning DistilBERT using SQuAD 2.0\n","\n","This notebook contains the following fine-tuning groups: Model_19\n","\n","....\n","\n","The starting-point for code in this file was found in the Medium blog post titled, Question Answering with DistilBERT (https://medium.com/@sabrinaherbst/question-answering-with-distilbert-ba3e178fdf3d). Main differences include:\n","\n"," - The DistilBERT model was pre-trined using SQuAD 2.0, rather than SQuAD 1.0\n"," - Exploring traditional split that included unseen test data  (i.e. not validation data)\n"," - Addition of adhoc dropout rate setting\n"," - Addition of alternate dataloader with Fixed-Length Truncation\n"," - Addition of performance analysis for each category\n","\n","...."],"metadata":{"id":"a5LmXSzh-iRq"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Mount Google Drive\n","from google.colab import

It is possible to construct malicious pickle data which will execute arbitrary code during unpickling (See https://github.com/pytorch/pytorch/blob/main/SECURITY.md#untrusted-models for more details). In a future release, the default value for `weights_only` will be flipped to `True`. This limits the functions that could be executed during unpickling. Arbitrary objects will no longer be allowed to be loaded via this mode unless they are explicitly allowlisted by the user via `torch.serialization.add_safe_globals`.

Question: where do thrust faults form? when rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding. in the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. deeper in the earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \" antiforms \", or where it buckles downwards, creating \" synforms \". if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. if some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up - direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n","   Predicted: \n","   Truth: the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are\n","\n","2.

Question: which group of people did the wagner act fail to protect? the first appearance of the term ' affirmative action ' was in the national labor relations act, better known as the wagner act, of 1935. : 15 proposed and championed by u. s. senator robert f. wagner of new york, the wagner act was in line with president roosevelt ' s goal of providing economic security to workers and other low - income groups. during this time period it was not uncommon for employers to blacklist or fire employees associated with unions. the wagner act allowed workers to unionize without fear of being discriminated against, and empowered a national labor relations board to review potential cases of worker discrimination. in the event of discrimination, employees were to be restored to an appropriate status in the company through ' affirmative action '. while the wagner act protected workers and unions it did not protect minorities, who, exempting the congress of industrial organizations, were often barred from union ranks. : 11 this original coining of the term therefore has little to do with affirmative action policy as it is seen today, but helped set the stage for all policy meant to compensate or address an individual ' s unjust treatment.
