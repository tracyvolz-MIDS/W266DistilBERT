Question: what field of study speculates about science fiction? there is considerable speculation both in science and science fiction as to why the observable universe is apparently almost entirely matter, and whether other places are almost entirely antimatter instead. in the early universe, it is thought that matter and antimatter were equally represented, and the disappearance of antimatter requires an asymmetry in physical laws called the charge parity ( or cp symmetry ) violation. cp symmetry violation can be obtained from the standard model, but at this time the apparent asymmetry of matter and antimatter in the visible universe is one of the great unsolved problems in physics. possible processes by which it came about are explored in more detail under baryogenesis.\n","   Predicted: \n","   Truth: \n","\n","4.

Question: what do phosphor - based leds luminous efficacies depend on? phosphor - based led efficiency losses are due to the heat loss from the stokes shift and also other phosphor - related degradation issues. their luminous efficacies compared to normal leds depend on the spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the led itself. for example, the luminous efficacy of a typical yag yellow phosphor based white led ranges from 3 to 5 times the luminous efficacy of the original blue led because of the human eye ' s greater sensitivity to yellow than to blue ( as modeled in the luminosity function ). due to the simplicity of manufacturing the phosphor method is still the most popular method for making high - intensity white leds. the design and production of a light source or light fixture using a monochrome emitter with phosphor conversion is simpler and cheaper than a complex rgb system, and the majority of high - intensity white leds presently on the market are manufactured using phosphor light conversion.\n","   Predicted: spectral distribution of the resultant light output and the original wavelength of the led itself\n","   Truth: the spectral distribution of the resultant light output\n","   F1 Score: 0.667\n","\n","2.

Question: where do thrust faults form? when rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. because rock units, other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways : through faulting and folding. in the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which cause deeper rock to move on top of shallower rock. because deeper rock is often older, as noted by the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. movement along faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. deeper in the earth, rocks behave plastically, and fold instead of faulting. these folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold buckles upwards, creating \" antiforms \", or where it buckles downwards, creating \" synforms \". if the tops of the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines, respectively. if some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up - direction is unknown, they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms and synforms.\n","   Predicted: in the shallow crust\n","   Truth: in the shallow crust\n","\n","4.
